## Introduction
Swiss has one of the best railway system in the world, but sometimes it fail and we where interested to find how many times.
We are aware that such things does exist, but we wanted our take on it. 
CFF/SBB Provied a extended API so we based our statistical analysis by subtracting the real time to predicted time.
Then we ploted the result to show it in a comprensive and interactive way.
Sadly we dicovered that Lausanne isn't the worst city when it comes to trains punctuality.
